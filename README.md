This project is a fork of http://samy.pl/keysweeper/ KeySweeper project for a UniTN course project.
The product is designed to communicate with a remote Django web application providing the keystrokes intercepted during
the listening phase.
This project was intended as a prototype for parents, giving them a powerful tool to take care of their childrens and prevent acts of
bullism or pedophilia.
